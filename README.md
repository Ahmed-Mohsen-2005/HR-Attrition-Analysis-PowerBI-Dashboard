## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**
- **Power Query (M Language)**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

1. **Remove Duplicates** – Ensure data integrity.
2. **Conditional Columns** – Classify numeric values (e.g., Education, Age).
3. **Replace Values** – Standardize and correct inconsistencies.
4. **Column Renaming & Type Changes** – Improve clarity and compatibility.

### Example:
- Education levels were mapped from numbers to text (`1 → Below College`, `2 → College`, etc.).
- Attrition column (`1 → Yes`, `0 → No`).
- Age was grouped into categorical ranges.

## 🧠 Data Modeling

- **FactPerformanceRating** (core table)
- **DimEmployees**
- **DimEducationLevel**
- **DimDate**
- **DimSatisfactionLevel**
- **RatingLevel**

These relationships enabled deep slicing of employee performance and satisfaction by time, education level, and demographics.
